# Input grids are: [recommended for - Optional "O", Initial run "I" (Stage 1), Subsequent run "S" (Stage 2)]
# 1a [ IS]. Outflow directions. Integers specifying 1 of the 8 neighboring cells following the esri convention. -> outfFN
# 1b [O S]. CCAR (Cummulative Catchment Area). Can calculate from outfFN. Integer number of upstream cells      -> ccarFN
# 2a [ IS]. LCM for "BASE" scenario. Used for (i) run-off values, (ii) FARL, (iii) cropping grids. Integer.     -> lcmFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (over all upstream cells). Overrules calc from LCM. Integer, summed percentages.      -> roffSumFN
# 2c [O S]. LCM for GREEN scenario. Used for GREEN runoff values, and FARL (unless lakesScnFN specified)    -> lcmScnFN
# 3a [O S]. FARL, imported for BASE scenario. Over-rides that calculated using lakeFN. Float, 0 - 1.            -> farlFN
# 3b [O S]. Grid specifying new lakes only using positive value for GREEN scenario. useLcmScnForFarlScn=F  -> lakesScnFN


#Output grids are as follows. Those exported on subsequent (GREEN scenario) runs are for diagnostic purposes only.
# 1  [OI ]. CCAR (BASE), [in units of number of grid cells]            -> ccarOutFN
# 2a [OI ]. Summed Runoff (BASE) [in units of summed percentage]       -> outRoffSumFN
# 2b [O S]. Summed Runoff (GREEN) [in units of summed percentage]   -> outRoffScnSumFN
# 3a [OI ]. FARL (BASE)                                                -> farlOutFN
# 3b [O S]. FARL (GREEN)                                            -> farlScnOutFN
# 4a [OIS]. flow  (BASE)      [m3/s]                                   -> flowBaseFN 
# 4b [O S]. flow  (GREEN)  [m3/s]                                   -> flowScnFN 
# 4c [O S]. flow ratio GREEN/BASE [fraction, q_scn/qbase - 1]       -> flowRatioFN
